Hello, My Hunt:showdown account was found to be closed, which confused me very much.    Because I am a loyal player and have never used any plug-ins or third-party cheating software, but today I found that my account was suddenly closed.

Here's the basic situation: on 1/10/2023, I logged in, bought EVENT DLC and character DLC, played three or four games without even killing players, and then today (1/13/2023), when I logged in steam, I got a letter from the developer  and telling me I was banned.

After a detailed analysis, I have to admit, I do use some cheaters for SINGLE player games such as WEMOD and Flings or something like that. I am very skeptical that this has caused serious problems.    Official reviewers mistakenly believed that I was performing illegal operations, which led to the wrong account closure.    Please investigate in detail.Or I was banned because I bought the DLC :)

Please help me investigate if there are any bugs in the game?    Or there is any behavior in the game that causes it to be closed.    Please help me handle it, thank you very much.    I love this game!

I also know that because of the impact of the global covid-19 epidemic, the global economy has weakened, and the official response has become very slow.    We can all understand this, but I still hope to reply to me soon.    If necessary, we will submit more evidence in the later reply.

At the same time, I hope you take good care of your body.    Covid-19 is a very serious disease.    I wish you good health!    Please restore my account permissions as soon as possible,

thank you so much !
